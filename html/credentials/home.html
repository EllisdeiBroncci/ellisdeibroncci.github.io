              </h2>

              <hr>

              <!--Main Body of Text-->
              <p>
                During my time at Sixth Form, my school ran two trips, nick-named
                correspondingly "The Japan Trip", and "The CERN Trip", both of 
                which were exclusive to students who took a science subject.
                There was also the rule that you could only really go on one of
                them, given the limited places availible on each. Besides the
                fact that the destination lay on the other hemishpere, and that
                the trip was partially subsidised by the Japanese State, I was 
                also drawn to the application process. You couldn't just put your
                name in, and get chosen at random, you had to actually compete
                for your place, by presenting a project related to a current 
                scientific inquiry that could be relevant to future developing
                industry. I liked this, not only because it treated students our
                age like adults, but also from that fact that a remarkable amount
                of the trip, gave control to it's students. You got to choose
                your project, time frame and to a great extent your itinery
                whilst you where there. At the time, and to this day, as much as
                I might have considered myself scientifically inclined, I was by
                far, never one of the top few of my year when it came down to it,
                but this was something new: it wasn't about how clever you were,
                it was about everything all at once. How you presented your work,
                what your ideas were, your leadership and application to your
                project. Despite getting a spot, and being one of the two
                projects to actually be persued, it project itself wasn't
                successful, but the idea behind it was. It taught me how to apply
                myself, the mistakes and logistics involved with material 
                synthesis, as well as the personal nature of leading a group
                project, and how at the end of it all, the actual assets and 
                success of anything involved with a community and a group, is 
                all to do with the people that you're with, what they're
                inspired by, and the relevance of what your doing to them, 
                and the people around you.
